Generates a lot of game states and with very simple heuristic bot. Cost is based on the score after X steps.
Then train neural network on this data. Only the first iteration shows significant decrease in error. In actual play, performance is worse than untrained network (random).
I didn't add other features or guidelines (like empty space, neighbours etc) because the goal is for the NN to learn.
Overall it took about 10-12 hours and I'm out of time, so abandoning it for now.

This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsVnuw5Bv0s normalized the board so that highest tile is 1.
Here https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/6591 notes that there's rotation symmetry, maybe use image moments

I think maybe the behaviour is wrong for things like 2202 when moving right

Aligning equivalent boards is working now! Aug 4th 2015
